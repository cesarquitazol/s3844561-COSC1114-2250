## Requirements

* gcc
* make

## Compilation

Run 'make' to build each of the task binaries.

The scripts and binaries can be run individually. Each takes two arguments,
  first is the input file and second is the output file.
  For example:

* ./task3 wlist_all/wlist_match1.txt Task3out.txt

## Usage

* After running any of the tasks, you MUST run RemoveTemp.sh. This will delete any temporary files, which ensures that certain tasks will run as intended.
